          Before we dive into <span class="april">april's</span> routine, we
          need to know that the order of the products you use in your routine
          are very important. This is because the order in which you use/layer
          your products allows for each product to work efficiently in terms of
          its consistency, benefits and barrier/shielding properties.
        </p>

          Also, these products may work for me but they may not work for you!

        <!-- 1. CLEANSER -->

        <h3>Step 1. Cleanser</h3>
        <p>
          Before you apply anything to your precious face, you must remove any
          dirt or makeup that is left over from either your beauty sleep or your
          busy day. This can include cleansing products such as
          water-based cleansers, oil cleansers, makeup wipes, etc.
        </p>
        <p id="Step-2">
          (To see specific recommendations of this product, visit my '<a
            href="recs.html#cleansers"
            class="link"
            >Recommendations</a
          >' page in the 'Cleansers' section.)
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 2. TONER -->

        <h3>Step 2. Toner</h3>
        <p>
          After washing away those impurities, you might want to rebalance the
          ph of your skin, cleanse anything you may have missed in the previous
          step or to just prepare your skin for the rest of your routine.
          Depending on your toner, it can help achieve any of these benefits. It
          isn't a necessary step as cleansing the skin can be enough, a majority
          of the time, but it is nice to have.
        </p>

        <p id="Step-2.5">
          (To see specific recommendations of this product, visit my '<a
            href="recs.html#toners"
            class="link"
            >Recommendations</a
          >' page in the 'Toners' section.)
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 2.5 ESSENCE -->

        <h3 class="extra">Step 2.5. Essence</h3>
        <p id="Step-3">
          If you're feeling extra (and have enough spare change in that student
          budget of yours), it's not a step that's needed but it can be
          beneficial to use an essence. An essence is like a toner with a
          thicker consistency that's primary job is to provide hydration and
          healing. Personally I live by using an essence, especially the
          <a
            href="https://www.cosrx.com/products/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence"

        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 3. SERUM -->

        <h3 id="Step-4">Step 3. Serum</h3>
        <p>
          If you have specific skin concerns that you would like to tackle, you
          can find a serum that matches what you're looking to fix/improve and
          apply it at this stage of the routine. This is so that it can be
          easily absorbed by the skin after the previous steps as it has the
          most lightweight, thin formula than the others.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 4. EYE CREAM -->

        <h3>Step 4. Eye Cream</h3>
        <p>
          Dark circles and eye bags can be a nuissance so now's the time to
          fight back against them! These usually small creams pack a punch
          despite being 20ml at most. They're perfect for applying before other
          creams as they are much thinner and can be absorbed into the skin
          faster without any bulkier creams getting in its way.
        </p>
        <p id="Step-5">
          <span class="bold">Note:</span> It is recommended that if your eye
          cream contains retinol, you can apply it after your moisturiser as it
          will act as an extra barrier for the eye cream to go through, reducing
          potential irritation.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 5. FACE CREAM -->

        <h3>Step 5. Face Cream</h3>
        <p>
          Face creams include products such as moisturiser, day creams, night
          creams, anti-aging creams, etc. These are often second to last or the
          very last step as they can be the thickest in consistency and help
          lock in all the products you have used before this. In my opinion, if
          there could only be three items you could use in your routine, it
          would be a cleanser, a moisturiser and our last product: a
          <span class="bold">sun cream</span>.

        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 5.5 FACIAL OIL -->

        <h3 class="extra">Step 5.5. Facial Oil</h3>
        <p id="Step-6">
          Personally, I am not a fan of facial oils as my skin is already oily
          enough (even though it has been debunked that facial oils in fact do
          not make oily skin worse), they can benefit others in terms of
          repairing your skin barrier and providing nutrients. It can be the
          heaviest out of all the products mentioned but it helps as an extra
          shield against the environment's skin threats. I have tried facial
          oils before when my skin wasn't as oily as it is now and I used to
          love the

        <!-- 6. SUN CREAM -->

        <h3>Step 6. Sun Cream</h3>
        <p>
          Probably one of the most emphasized products by dermatologists and
          skincare experts alike (and for good reasons) the final step of your
          routine must include sun cream (unless your moisturiser has a good
          amount of spf). It provides the most important barrier of protection
          in your arsenal of products which is why it must be applied last so
          that it's shielding properties can be used to it's fullest potential
          against the threat of skin cancer and UV rays.
        </p>

          Now that we have a knowledge of what a routine should look like and
          why, let's look at <span class="april">april's</span> morning and
