        <h1>About april</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="april">april</span> is a blog-style website that I
          created solely due to my 'healthy-obsession' and long journey with
          skincare and how I love to try to inspire others to be as passionate
          about their skin as I am.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was inspired by my friends, who would beg me to put all my
          knowledge on the topic somewhere online where they could reread it
          over and over again instead of struggling to remember it on the spot.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">However</span>, I would like to make it clear that
          I am no skincare expert, a dermatologist or anyone with clearance to
          advise people on what to do with their skin. I would encourage you to
          do your own research and consult with a dermatologist or other
          qualified professional before trying any new skin care products or
          routines.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Skincare?</h2>
        <p>
          Like most young teens (except the lucky minority who will always have
          clear skin no matter what they do) I struggled a lot with acne and
          other skin concerns. They first appeared when I was in primary school
          which was not quite the blessing an 11-year-old child would want. In
          fact, a lot of my confidence was lost during those years because of
          the severity of my pimples and other skin impurities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until I visited a dermatologist for the first and only time
          that I learned about the causes of acne and was prescribed an ointment
          along with skincare tips. Prior to that, I only used a bar of soap and
          water. Within a day of following the new routine, I noticed
          significant improvement and was amazed at how simply knowing my skin
          type and using the right products could make such a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have made it my mission to put extra effort in taking
          care of my skin, learning what ingredients work best for me and
          building the most efficient morning and night routines. And hopefully
          this website inspires you to do the same!
        </p>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2>Why 'april'?</h2>
        <p>The name <span class="april">april</span> comes from my own name!</p>
        <p>
          Since the website is mostly about my own interest and my routines and
          what products I use, then it would only be logical to name my website
          after me.
        </p>
        <p>
          (And no, I was <span class="bold">not</span> born in the month of
          April).
        </p>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2>How Do You Choose Which Products to Use?</h2>
        <p>Trial and error.</p>
        <p>
          I have been experimenting with all types of products and ingredients
          whether it was commercial skincare products or even natural
          ingredients like honey and tumeric (which I've personally learned to
          not try again) for as long as eight years and despite having a very
          solid arsenal of products at the moment, my skin will always be
          changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, I choose products that suit me in the moment. If my
          skin is very oily I go for foaming cleansers and non-oily creams. If
          my skin is dry, I go for hydrating toners and thick moisturisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the best products for your skin, it's important to be
          adventurous and try out different options. However, it's crucial to do
          your research on the ingredients to ensure they are safe and suitable
          for your skin type.
        </p>

        <h2>Do You Have Any Advice on Beginning Skincare?</h2>
        <p>Patience is a virtue.</p>
        <p>
          Although it has been 8 long years, I still haven't reached my goal of
          'glass skin'. I still struggle with hyperpigmentation (also known as
          'acne scars') but I am much more confident than I was when I first
          started. I will forever remain patient in this journey and continue to
          experiment with various products until I find what truly works for me.
