        <p>Good morning! Welcome to my morning routine!</p>
        <p id="Step-1">
          Compared to the routine explained in the '<a
            href="routine.html"
            class="link"
            >Routine Order</a

          that not all the steps have to be followed, but that the order of the
          products you use in your routine is very important.

        <br />

        <!-- 1. CLEANSER -->

        <h3>Step 1. Cleanser</h3>
        <p>
          Morning cleansing always feels like a wake-up call to me, whether I'm
          splashing my face with Arctic-level cold water or opening my pores
          with steamy warm water (depending on the weather that day and how I'm
          feeling). I prefer to use a water-based cleanser that I first
          discovered in the Philippines when I was on vacation there in the
          summer of '22:

        <div class="container-image">

        <p id="Step-2">
          This product isn't as well-known as its other Asian counterparts, but
          I have a feeling it could live up to the Asian skincare hype. It is a
          South Korean product with very simple, non-irritating ingredients,
          such as their Botaniceutical Plus 10. These ingredients are harmless
          to the skin and are found in nature, such as plant extracts and water.
          It also contains Milk Protein Extract, which hydrates the skin and is
          very gentle.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 2. ESSENCE -->

        <h3>Step 2. Essence</h3>
        <p>
          I like to skip the toner step in the morning, not because I don't
          think it's important, but because I am currently a budgeting college
          student. If I had the money, I would get the

            class="link"
            >Etude House Soon Jung PH 5.5 Relief Toner</a
          >. However, instead of toner, I go straight to an essence that I
          consider my holy grail product in my entire routine:

        <p id="Step-3">
          Now, I know what you're thinking: Snail Mucin?! And the answer is yes:
          Snail Mucin! It is a very moisturising ingredient that can also help
          fight aging or heal wounds like acne scars. The reason why I claim
          this product to be my holy grail is because no matter how dry my skin
          is, it manages to restore all moisture back into it. I am a big fan of
          COSRX and their Snail Mucin line so don't be startled if you see
          another similar product by them appear later on!
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 3. SERUM -->

        <h3>Step 3. Serum</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, serums can help target specific skin concerns.
          Personally, I have been trying to tackle acne scars and
          hyperpigmentation for many years now and haven't quite found the right
          product just yet. But this recently new entry might serve to be a
          contender:

        <h3 class="extra">Beauty Joseon Glow Serum: Propolis + Niacinamide</h3>
        <div class="container-image">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/4135/7989/products/0O8A9448.jpg?v=1653271835"

          <div class="overlay-MRoutine">
            <a
              href="https://www.notino.ie/beauty-of-joseon/glow-serum-propolis-niacinamide-regenerating-and-brightening-serum/"

            </a>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p id="Step-4">
          It may sound like a witch's spell but Propolis and Niacinamide are
          actually very powerful and beneficial ingredients. I have stood by
          Niacinamide for a long time as it is commonly known to brighten
          hyperpigmentation but I normally use it to reduce sebum production
          which is a fancy term for making your skin less oily. Propolis on the
          other hand is a fairly new agent to my arsenal. Just like Snail Mucin,
          this ingredient comes from another insect: bees! It fights acne and
          also brightens skin tone. Overall, this serum leaves my skin glowing
          and I can already see my acne scars fading slowly.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 4. FACE CREAM -->

        <h3>Step 4. Face Cream</h3>
        <p>
          Since I use a lot of products that target different concerns in the
          morning, I tend to use a moisturiser that is fairly basic as to lock
          in all the layers of skincare I have already applied.

        <p id="Step-5">
          This moisturiser has been very prominent in the skincare industry ever
          since the first Covid lockdown back in March 2020. Just like many
          products in this routine, it became popular due to TikTok. The
          Ordinary brand itself is very reliable for its simple formulas and
          this moisturiser is no exception. It uses a mix of hydrating
          ingredients including hyaluronic acid which is widely known to combat
          dry skin.

        <br />

        <!-- 5. SUN CREAM -->
        <h3>Step 5. Sun Cream</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, the
          <span style="font-style: italic">crema de la cr√®me</span> of skincare
          products: sun cream. I will admit that I didn't take sun cream as
          seriously as I should have when I was younger but after lots of
          research (and TikTok videos of experts begging people to use it) it is
          a product that I will never forget in my routine. I am very picky with
          my sun creams and choose them based on two properties: white cast and
          thickness. Fortunately, I have recently found the best one for me:

        </div>

        <p>
          Another product from Beauty of Joseon that is worth mentioning is
          their sun cream. If you're wondering why many Asians have such young
          and clear skin, it's because we take our sun protection very
          seriously. This sun cream is lightweight and doesn't cause too much of
          a white cast, which is a phenomenon where the sun cream may make your
          skin appear paler. It comes in a 50ml tube, making it perfect for
          on-the-go.
