          Tired already? Don't fall asleep just yet, we still have my night
          routine!
        </p>
        <p id="Step-1">
          Again, I'm starting to sound like a broken record but, compared to the
          routine explained in the '<a href="routine.html" class="link"
            >Routine Order</a
          >' page, my routine, doesn't include all of those steps as I've
          mentioned that not all the steps have to be followed but the order of
          the products you use in your routine is very important.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 1. CLEANSER -->
        <h3>Step 1. Cleanser</h3>
        <p>
          A nighttime cleanse is more important than a morning cleanse. Why?
          Because of the makeup you may still have on or all the dirt that
          potentially built up on your skin during the day. But you can't just
          cleanse once! You should do a double cleanse to make sure everything
          has been washed away.
        </p>
        <p id="oil">
          A double cleanse is where you first wash your face with an oil-based
          product which will help break down your makeup, excess sebum (oil),
          and the residue of sunscreen that's still lingering on your face. Then
          you follow up with a water-based cleanser which cleans out impurities
          that are water-soluble like dirt and sweat.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- OIL CLEANSER -->
        <h3>First Cleanse: Oil</h3>
        <p>
          In order to use an oil cleanser, you have to massage it onto a dry
          face with dry hands. Once it is fully incorporated into the skin, you
          wet your hands and massage your face again to emulsify the oil. This
          means that the oil cleanser will start to turn milky white which helps
          get rid of the oily feeling it gives. Then wet your hands even more to
          fully wash off the oil.

        <p id="water">
          Our first and only Japanese entry, this oil cleanser lives up to its
          name - it's indeed speedy. It makes the tedious task of oil cleansing
          a much quicker task. It is also very effective against stubborn makeup
          like mascara and eyeliner. Among all the oil cleansers I've tried,
          this one is easily my favourite thanks to how fast I can rinse it off
          and how soft it leaves my skin feeling.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- WATER-BASED CLEANSER -->
        <h3>Second Cleanse: Water-based</h3>
        <p>
          In general, most cleansers are water-based so there is no need to go
          out of your way to find one. Just like my
          <a href="morning.html#Step-4" class="link">morning moisturiser</a>, I
          have been using this basic, reliable product for a long time:

        <p id="Step-2">
          Compared to the other items on this list, this cleanser may seem
          unremarkable. However, its simplicity makes it highly suitable for
          sensitive skin. Don't let its lack of complexity fool you, though -
          it's just as effective as the rest! In fact, sometimes simplicity in
          skincare can be a real blessing, and this cleanser is a prime example
          of that.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- 2. TONER -->

        <h3>Step 2. Toner</h3>
        <p>
          If you couldn't tell so far, during the night, I prefer to keep my
          routine simple. Because of this, to address my skin concerns I use
          exfoliating toners which help balance your skin's pH and exfoliate its
          surface. However, because they can contain such potent ingredients, I
          mostly use them every second day or twice a week. Again, as someone
          who suffers from hyperpigmentation, these toners really help battle
          that issue.

        <p id="Step-3">
          Designed for those new to chemical exfoliation, this product offers a
          gentle introduction to AHAs and BHAs. What is AHA or BHA you may ask?
          They are hydroxy acids that are used to treat various skin conditions
          like acne. The toner is conveniently packaged in a spray bottle,
          making application a breeze. It's particularly well-suited for those
          with sensitive skin, as the acids work gradually and without the
          typical tingling sensation often associated with exfoliating toners.

        <!-- 3. FACE CREAM -->

        <h3>Step 3. Face Cream</h3>
        <p>
          To keep my face hydrated overnight, I prefer to use a different face
          cream than I do during the day. As I've mentioned previously, I'm a
          big fan of Snail Mucin - so this next product has ingredients that
          should come as no surprise:

          At this point, I might as well be sponsored by COSRX (unfortunately, I
          am not but I would love to be). This face cream is essentially a cream
          version of the
          <a href="morning.html#Step-2" class="link"
            >COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence</a
          >
          that I use in the morning. Recently labelled as ELLE Editor's Choice
          for 2023, it is a powerhouse cream that soothes and repairs irritated
          skin. What's more is that it absorbs very quickly and efficiently.
          Unlike some face creams with a gel-like texture, this one leaves my
          skin feeling plump and hydrated without any sticky or dry residue.
